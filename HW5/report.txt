1.  Maximum Weighted Independent Set
    Q: What's the complexity?

    It's O(n).
    Since T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1):
    each iteration the input is reduced by 1 or 2 and in each iteration,
    and we do constant time opeartions in each iteration.

2.  Number of n-node BSTs
    Qa: What's the complexity of this DP?
    O(n^2)

    Qb: What's the name of this famous number series?
    ???
