Q0: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of quicksort. Briefly explain each case.
    Best-case: 
        Pivots are always in the middle of the list (in terms of value). Then the we will have
        lg(n) times of recursion. Each recursion, we need to go through the whole list, then the time complexities
        is O(n*lg(n)).

    Worse-case: 
        Partitions are fully unbalanced for all recurions which means, in each recursion, 
        we need to go through the whole remaining list and only the pivot is taken out from the list
        Therefore, the time complexity is (n+n-1+n-2+n-3...+1) which is O(n^2).

    Average-case: 
        Ramdomized pivots will result in theta(n*lg(n)) time complexity.

Q1: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities? Briefly explain.
    Best-case: 
        Similar to quicksort. Pivots' value are in the middle of the list. What's different is that
        in each recurion, we will throw half of the list. That is, the numebr of times we need to check values is
        (n+n/2+n/4+n/8+...+1), which is O(n).

    Worse-case: 
        Simialr to the Worse case of quicksort. Each recurion we will only be able to reduce the size of the 
        list by 1. Thus, we have (n+n-1+n-2+n-3+n-4+...+1) which is O(n^2).

    Average-case:
        Ramdomized pivots will result in theta(n) time complexity.

Q2: What are the time complexities for the operations implemented?
    sorted(tree):
        Best-case: O(n)
        Worse-case: O(n)
        Average-case: theta(n)
    search(tree, x):
        Best-case: O(lg(n))
        Worse-case: O(n) for extermely unbalanced tree
        Average-case: theta(lg(n))
    insert(tree, x):
        same as search(tree, x)
